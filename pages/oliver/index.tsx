        <Typography>
          My name is Oliver Levay and I like developing websites.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          I especially enjoy creating cool and intuitive user experiences.

        <Typography variant="h3">Jamstack</Typography>
        <Typography>
          With "cool" user experiences, good performance is a given. That's why
          I'm a big fan of modern web frameworks such as{" "}

          With good attention to detail and a tenacious perfectionist, I have a
